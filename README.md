## IPFS Browser extension

Store all your data in IPFS/Filecoin and enjoy the fun of decentralization

Have you ever needed to quickly upload something to IPFS,  e.g. some token metadata while minting an NFT, or maybe something as simple as posting an image on a forum that does not have an upload functionality?

Well, here is the **IPFS Quick Upload** browser extension. Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Brave, this extension allows you to upload anything on IPFS in just 1 click. Click upload, choose a file and you get an IPFS address with the CID of your file. You also get an HTTP address using the _Infura_ gateway so your file is just ready to use. Copy the link, paste it anywhere, it just works! 

## Simple, Elegant, Useful

To install the extension on your browser, download `extension.zip` from the [github repo](https://github.com/AymericBethencourt/IPFS-quick-upload), extract it, then check `Developer mode` in your browser extensions then `Load unpacked extension`. The extension has been submitted to the chrome store and firefox store but is still under review:

Note that this screenshot has been uploaded to IPFS using the _Quick Upload_ extension ;)
